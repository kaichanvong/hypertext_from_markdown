# HTML from MarkDown

Changes your text format into a different format (HyperText << markdown)

A personal ruby project for turning markdown-text into hypertext (markup language). The goal of this is to seperate writing HTML from my design's HTML. The initial build is simply to convert simple notes in MD into the HTML for my personal website. To that, it does the job. Tests included simply demonstrate changes to notes and design. The ruby files are going to change in the future to help note the better parts of the HTML/MD language.

**Help** can be found in other projects/repositories, you could look at kramdown for this... but your choice. Puss!!!
