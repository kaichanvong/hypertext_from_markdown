# HTML from MarkDown

Changes your text format into a different format (HyperText << markdown)

A personal ruby project for changing markdown-text into hypertext (markup language). The goal of this is to seperate writing HTML from my design's Hyper-Text. The initial build is simply to convert simple notes for my personal website. To that, it does the job. Tests included simply demonstrate changes to notes and design. The ruby-prog files are going to change in the future to help note the better parts of the Hyper-Text/MD language.

**Help** can be found in other projects/repositories, you could look at kramdown for this... but your choice. Please code with "great responsibility" (Marvel Comics)
