# HTML from MarkDown

Changes your text format into a different format (HyperText << markdown)

A personal ruby project for changing markdown-text into hypertext (markup language). The goal of this is mostly ruby-prog-lang grasping Hyper-Text, Markdown & more.

The ruby-prog files are going to change in the future to help note the better parts of the Hyper-Text/MD language. New helpers can be found in other projects.

**Help** can be found in other projects/repositories, you could look at kramdown for this... but your choice. Please code with "great responsibility" (Marvel Comics)
