# My MarkDown to HTML
A personal ruby project for turning markdown-text into hypertext (markup language). 

The goal of this is to seperate writing HTML from my design's HTML. The initial build is simply to convert simple notes in MD into the HTML for my personal website. To that, it does the job. Tests included simply demonstrate changes to notes and design. 

NB. I should re-write this.
